  summary: 'I am a t-shaped web developer with a penchant for delightful UX and beautiful design. I believe that great software isnâ€™t just about pixel-perfect designs and clean code, but it should also have a top-notch user experience to match. I bring a sense of empathy to my work which allows me to smoothly communicate between project managers, designers and engineers alike. I thrive in environments that encourage out-of-the-box thinking and cross-disciplinary collaboration. To me, the web is a canvas on which I can craft products that people will love to use.',
